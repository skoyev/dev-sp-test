local service provider for development with simplesamlphp

The idea behind it:
- to actually work on our simplesamlphp based packages, we often need additional components that are leightweight and just stand in for the actual products we use.
- this is a local service provider (read: application that uses SAML to login)

This repo also contains configs to use with dev environment for idp
